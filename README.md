# remark-oembed

[![Downloads][downloads-badge]][downloads] [![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]

Converts URLs surrounded by newlines into embeds.

The important part of this code is taken directly from
[Benedicte Raae](https://www.raae.codes/)'s excellent
[gatsby-remark-oembed](https://github.com/raae/gatsby-remark-oembed) plugin, so
thank you very much [@raae](https://github.com/raae) üôè

## Installation

[yarn][]:

```bash
yarn add @agentofuser/remark-oembed
```

## Usage

Say we have the following file, `demo.md`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```markdown
Hey this is a nice youtube video about making modern react apps with gatsby:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN0xHSk2P8Q

Check it out üëÜ
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var remark = require('remark')
var oembed = require('@agentofuser/remark-oembed')

remark()
  .use(oembed)
  .process(fs.readFileSync('demo.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
Hey this is a nice youtube video about making modern react apps with gatsby:

<iframe

  allow="accelerometer; 
    autoplay;

  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
