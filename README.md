<!-- Add `giphy:` as a
[CommonMark URI scheme](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#scheme).

Example: -->

Take `![](giphy:search_term)` and replace with first matching gif from giphy.

## Installation

[yarn][]:

```bash
yarn add @agentofuser/remark-giphy
```

## Usage

Say we have the following file, `demo.md`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```markdown
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

![](giphy:whats_up 'How is it going?')
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var remark = require('remark')
var giphy = require('@agentofuser/remark-giphy')

remark()
  .use(giphy)
  .process(fs.readFileSync('demo.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/eoVusT7Pi9ODe/giphy.gif 'How is it going?')
```

## API

### `remark().use(giphy)`

Take `![](giphy:search_term)` and replace with first matching gif from giphy.
